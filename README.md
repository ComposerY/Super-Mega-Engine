# F.A.Q.

Read the [F.A.Q. page](https://github.com/rafaelcp/Open-Mega-Engine/wiki/F.A.Q.) in the wiki.

# Guidelines for Contribution
- Everything that can be found in MM 1-10 is welcome (mechanics, weapons, bosses, 8-bit resources, etc.)
- Features not present in *every* game should be made optional (include a boolean variable set to false by default) (e.g., start charging while sliding, shop, initial stage, etc.)
- Features not present in *any* game will be discussed by the contributors, but should be optional anyway
- Original content won't be added. This is left for individual games.
- Solve any merge conflicts
- If you propose a new feature, be prepared to be assigned to it
- If you don't work on your assignments for more than 30 days, they may get closed
- If your pull request gets merged and a bug is found later on, you may be assigned to fix it

# Goals
- Ideally, the engine should be an empty game, and levels, weapons and bosses (from examples or created by the user) should be added by the user according to his individual game 
- It should be possible to replicate any of the 8-bit MM games with the engine
