This is a fork of [Mega Engine](http://sprites-inc.co.uk/showthread.php?tid=1648) 1.3 for GM Studio by [WreckingPrograms](https://twitter.com/WreckingProg), intended to improve the code and incorporate contributions from users.

**The engine has several features, including:**

- Accurate movement, physics, object interaction and more
- Sliding and buster charging (can be disabled with ease)

- Several built-in special weapons, with flexibility in adding new ones or changing existing ones
- Built-in enemies, as well as flexibility in adding your own
- Various example gimmicks included in the engine, and flexibility in adding your own
- An example Robot Master with full AI, and flexibility to add your own bosses
- A customizable title screen, stage select, boss introduction screen, weapon get screen, game over screen and pause screen
- E-Tanks, M-Tanks, health drops, weapon drops and extra lives
- Fully functional checkpoints

- Password system
- Intro stage support
- Dialog text system
- HTML5 support (if you have the GM exporter, you can generate a browser version of your game, like the HTML5 demo available here)
- Gamepad support (desktop only)
- Friendly to multiple keyboard layouts (multiple keys assigned to shoot and jump)

# Goals
- Ideally, the engine should be an empty game, and levels, weapons and bosses (from examples or created by the user) should be added by the user according to his individual game 
- It should be possible to replicate any of the 8-bit MM games with the engine
